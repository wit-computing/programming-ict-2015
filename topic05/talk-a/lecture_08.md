#More sophisticated behaviour

In this presentation we discuss the application programming interface (API) of a class. We examine how random data may be generated. We revisit collections and examine the HashMap and HashSet generic classes. We see how arrays may be declared multi-dimensional and provide the example of a two-dimensional array being initialized within a pair of *for* loops. A range of topics is examined related to the accompanying labs such as anonymous objects, chaining and control flow using the *switch*, *break* and *continue* statements.
